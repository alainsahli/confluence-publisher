= Confluence Publisher

The Confluence Publisher allows documentation written in AsciiDoc and versioned directly with the documented code base
to be published to a Confluence space.

It converts the resulting AsciiDoc HTML output to XHTML compatible with
Confluence, manages included resources as Confluence attachments and ensures that only content modified since the last
publication is again re-published.

The documentation can be found link:asciidoc-confluence-publisher-doc/etc/docs/00-index.adoc[here].

Some useless changes in order to test the contributor build.
